<p>The following document summarizes a vision for a common Python package
used across the whole community, and how we can best all work together
to achieve this.  In the following document, this common package will
be referred to as the core package. This vision is not set in stone,
and we are committed to adapting it to whatever process and guidelines
work in practice.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal that we seek is a package that would contain much of
the core functionality and some common tools required across the
community, but not <em>everything</em> a domain scientist will ever need. The
aim is primarily to avoid duplication for common core tasks, and to
provide a robust framework upon which to build more complex tools.</p>
<p>Such a common package should not preclude any other package from
existing, because there will always be more complex and/or specialized
tools required. These tools will be able to rely on a single core
library for many tasks, and thus reduce the number of dependencies,
reduce duplication of functionality, and increase consistency of their
interfaces.</p>
<div class="section" id="procedure">
<h2>Procedure<a class="headerlink" href="#procedure" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>With the help of the community, the coordination committee will start by
identifying a few of key areas where initial development/consolidation
will be needed (such as conversion to reciprocal space, non-linear
fitting, detector corrections, time correlations, etc.) and will
encourage teams to be formed to build standalone packages implementing
this functionality. These packages will be referred to as affiliated
packages (meaning that they are intended for future integration in the
core package).</p>
<p>A set of requirements will be set out concerning the interfaces and
classes/methods that affiliated packages will need to make available in
order to ensure consistency between the different components. As the
core package grows, new potential areas/components for the core package
will be identified. Competition cannot be avoided, and will not be
actively discouraged, but whenever possible, developers should strive to
work as a team to provide a single and robust affiliated package, for
the benefit of the community.</p>
<p>The affiliated packages will be developed outside the core package in
independent repositories, which will allow the teams the choice of tool
and organization. Once an affiliated package has implemented the desired
functionality, and satisfies quality criteria for coding style,
documentation, and testing, it will be considered for inclusion in the
core package, and further development will be done directly in the core
package either via direct access to the repository, or via patches/pull
requests.</p>
<p>To ensure uniformity across affiliated packages, and to facilitate
integration with the core package, developers who wish to submit their
affiliated packages for inclusion in the core will need to follow the
layout of a ‘template’ package that will be provided before development
starts.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="dependencies">
<h2>Dependencies<a class="headerlink" href="#dependencies" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Affiliated packages should be able to be imported with only the
following dependencies:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The Python Standard Library, NumPy, SciPy, pandas, and Matplotlib</li>
<li>Components already in the core package</li>
</ul>
<p>Other packages may be used, but must be imported as needed rather than
during the initial import of the package.</p>
<p>If a dependency is needed, but is an affiliated package, the dependent
package will need to wait until the dependency is integrated into the
core package before being itself considered for inclusion. In the mean
time, it can make use of the other affiliated package in its current
form, or other packages, so as not to stall development. Thus, the first
packages to be included in the core will be those only requiring the
standard library, NumPy, SciPy, pandas, and Matplotlib.</p>
<p>If the required dependency will never be part of a main package, then by
default the dependency can be included but should be imported as needed
(meaning that it only prevents the importing of that component, not the
entire core package), unless a strong case is made and a general
consensus is reached by the community that this dependency is important
enough to be required at a higher level.</p>
<p>This system means that packages will be integrated into the core package
in an order depending on the dependency tree, and also ensures that the
interfaces of packages being integrated into the core package are
consistent with those already in the core package.</p>
<p>Initially, no dependency on GUI toolkits will be allowed in the core
package. If the community reaches agrees on a single toolkit that could
be used, then this toolkit will be allowed (but will only be imported as
needed).</p>

<div class="section" id="keeping-track-of-affiliated-packages">
<h2>Keeping track of affiliated packages<a class="headerlink" href="#keeping-track-of-affiliated-packages" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Affiliated packages will be listed in a central location (in addition to
PyPI/conda-forge).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="existing-packages">
<h2>Existing Packages<a class="headerlink" href="#existing-packages" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Developers who already have existing packages will be encouraged to
continue supporting them for the benefit of users until the core library
is considered stable, contains this functionality, and is released to
the community. Thereafter, developers should encourage users to
transition to using the functionality in the core package, and
eventually phase out their own packages, unless they provide added value
over the core package.</p>
