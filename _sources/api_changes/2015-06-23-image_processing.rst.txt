======================================
 Image Processing: Arithmetic changes
======================================
Changed the name of the package folder img_proc to image_processing for
explicit clarity for users.
Changed the name of module mathops.py to arithmetic.py since this module
explicitly wraps or defines all of the basic image arithmetic and logic
operations
